Description: Trajan
        ======
        
        Trajan was Roman Emperor from 98 to 117 AD. Born into a non-patrician family in the province of Hispania Baetica,
        in Spain[2] Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor Domitian. Serving as a legatus legionis
        in Hispania Tarraconensis, in Spain, in 89 Trajan supported the emperor against a revolt on the Rhine led
        by Antonius Saturninus.[3] In September 96, Domitian was succeeded by Marcus Cocceius Nerva, an old and
        childless senator who proved to be unpopular with the army. After a brief and tumultuous year in power,
        a revolt by members of the Praetorian Guard compelled him to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir
        and successor. Nerva died on 27 January 98, and was succeeded by his adopted son without incident.
